And then just regular stuff. Let's list a few things

- Thing one, which leads to
  - Other thing
  - And other other things
- Conclusion

More stuff. Something :hook[tangentially related]{id="tangent"}. Additionally, let's define something :definition[typographically]{def="You know what this means."}. I'll write more things after.

Moving on, it's time to write some code.

```
{
  "test": "y"
  "test": "y"
  "test": "y"
  "test": "y"
  "test": "y"
  "test": "y"
  "test": "y"
  "test": "y"
  "test": "y"
}
```

:footnote[A _lot_ of things here]{id="tangent"}
